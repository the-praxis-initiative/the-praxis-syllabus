Existing courses on semantic web, ontologies, information systems: 
* Peter Fox (RPI) [XInformatics](https://tw.rpi.edu//web/courses/Xinformatics/2018)

Existing tutorials:
* Excellent resource on 'graph-based data science' - [Knowledge Graph Lab](https://derwen.ai/docs/kgl/) - The main goal is to leverage idiomatic Python for common use cases in data science and data engineering work that require graph data, presenting graph-based data science as an emerging practice.
  - Provides a simple abstraction layer in Python 3.6+ for building knowledge graphs [Graph-Based Data Science](https://github.com/DerwenAI/kglab/)

Important first steps in praxis:
* From [Knowledge Graphs: New Directions for Knowledge Representation on the Semantic Web (Dagstuhl Seminar 18371)](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2019/10328/) "Provide guidelines and best practices to help developers use and appreciate large-scale KGs that are inherently messy, diverse and evolving"
